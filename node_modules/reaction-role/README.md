**ReactionRole** is a module that allows you to create Discord reaction role easily!

This module is compatible with all node.js discord wrappers (like discord.js, eris, discord.js-commando etc.)

You also don't need to write any bot code if you want! You can also use this module alone. You just need a Discord Bot Token!

Database support and TypeScript definitions are built-in

# IMPORTANT NOTE

---

You have to turn on "Server Members Intent" option to use this package properly.

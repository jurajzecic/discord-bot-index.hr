An in-memory node.js cache with random eviction skewed to evict least-used items.

## Usage
```javascript
// Require Guild.
var Guild = require('guild');

// Create new cache to hold a maximum of 500 items.
var cache = Guild.cacheWithSize(500);

// Put an object into the cache under the key 'itemA'.
cache.put('itemA', objectToCache);

// Retrieving the same item from the cache.
var retrievedObject = cache.get('itemA');

// Remove item from cache.
cache.remove('itemA');

// Empty/reset the cache.
cache.reset();
```


The best way to add Guild Cache to your project is to use ```npm```. 

```bash
npm install guild --save
```

## Cache Eviction
The eviction process happens when an item is added to the cache when the cache is already full. The process is non-deterministic as its based on probabilities. Cached items that have a high hit count have a lower chance of being evicted, and vice versa. Eviction probabilities are constrained between 10% and 90% for each item.
